# 📋 Paste me ALL! #
**Removes a Common Friction Point**

How many times Designers have new designs where they need to replicate content for multiple table-cells or forms fields, with original content provided? <br>
Figma doesn’t natively support bulk text copying-pasting between multiple elements at once, forcing repetitive manual edits. <br>
This plugin **removes that pain point**, saving minutes per iteration—which scales to hours saved across a project.

In fast-moving teams, designers, content strategists, and developers iterate on copy frequently. Bulk copy-paste ensures content consistency across screens or components without introducing mismatches or typos. That means fewer QA issues and a smoother handoff to developers.

# 🚀 Features #

**Bulk Text Selection** – Select up to 20 _Text elements_ in your Figma file. <br>
**Bulk Copy-Paste** – Copy text from selected elements **without the need of copying 1 by 1 content**, and paste them into an equal number of other selected elements, keeping the same destination style! <br>
**Selection Validation** – Instantly see how many Text elements are selected and whether your operation is valid. <br>
**Smart Error Handling** – Get an error message if the numbers don’t match, so you don’t overwrite or lose content. <br>
**Intuitive UI** – A clean, minimal panel within Figma for effortless copy-paste management. <br>
